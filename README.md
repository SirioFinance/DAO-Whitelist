# DAO-Whitelist

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code used to define the final list of holders of Nebula Genesis, Cosmic Cyphers, and users who supplied on Sirio Finance before the exploit.

## Check Elegibility
In the repository, you will find the file wallet_addresses.csv. This file contains all the wallets we identified from:

1. A snapshot of Nebula Genesis holders, taken using the SentX Tool
2. A snapshot of Cosmic Cyphers holders, taken using the SentX Tool
3. A snapshot of Sirio suppliers, retrieved through our internal APIs

If you are a holder of NG or CC, or if you deposited funds on Sirio, your address should be listed in the `wallet_addresses.csv` file. You can verify this in two ways:

1. Search for your ID within this repository. After clicking on the `wallet_addresses.csv` file, follow the steps shown in the screenshots below
2. Download the `wallet_addresses.csv` file, open it on your device, and search for your ID using your preferred CSV file viewer

If your wallet should be included but is missing, we invite you to open a ticket on our Discord:

or send us an email at connect@sirio.finance with the transaction details proving you belong to one of the three categories. Once we verify your eligibility, we will update the CSV file accordingly.

## Get your NFT
To receive your Sirio Recovery DAO NFT, you simply need to make sure your address is included in the CSV file. The following steps will take place:

1. We will wait approximately three weeks to correct any errors and accept potential reclaim requests. This period may be extended further, as it will help us determine the total number of NFTs to be minted.
2. Once the final number of NFTs is confirmed, we will proceed to mint and distribute them to all eligible users. Stay tuned to find out which Token ID is associated with your address.

## Repo & Code Architecture
The repository consists of the following files:

1. Two snapshots obtained via SentX for holders of Cosmic Cyphers and Nebula Genesis, respectively: `0.0.7089383.csv` and `0.0.7829347.csv`
2. The `SUPPLIERS_LIST.json` file, which contains the snapshot of all suppliers of the Sirio protocol
3. The Python script `wallets_list.py`, which extracts all addresses from the two CSVs and the JSON file, and aggregates them into a single final file: `wallet_addresses.csv`
