# DAO-Whitelist

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code used to define the final list of holders of Nebula Genesis, Cosmic Cyphers, and users who supplied on Sirio Finance before the exploit.

## Check Elegibility
In the repository, you will find the file wallet_addresses.csv. This file contains all the wallets we identified from:

1. A snapshot of Nebula Genesis holders, taken using the SentX Tool
2. A snapshot of Cosmic Cyphers holders, taken using the SentX Tool
3. A snapshot of Sirio suppliers, retrieved through our internal APIs

If you are a holder of NG or CC, or if you deposited funds on Sirio, your address should be listed in the wallet_addresses.csv file. You can verify this in two ways:

1. Search for your ID within this repository. After clicking on the wallet_addresses.csv file, follow the steps shown in the screenshots below
2. Download the wallet_addresses.csv file, open it on your device, and search for your ID using your preferred CSV file viewer

If your wallet should be included but is missing, we invite you to open a ticket on our Discord:
https://discord.com/channels/1192554206775754842/1202345688239710258/1340005780472205312
or send us an email at connect@sirio.finance with the transaction details proving you belong to one of the three categories. Once we verify your eligibility, we will update the CSV file accordingly.

## Get your NFT
To receive your Sirio Recovery DAO NFT, you simply need to make sure your address is included in the CSV file. The following steps will take place:

1. We will wait approximately three weeks to correct any errors and accept potential reclaim requests. This period may be extended further, as it will help us determine the total number of NFTs to be minted.
2. Once the final number of NFTs is confirmed, we will proceed to mint and distribute them to all eligible users. Stay tuned to find out which Token ID is associated with your address.
